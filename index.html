        <h1>Justin Welch</h1>
        <p><em>Founder and fine art photographer of <strong><a href="https://www.justinwelchphotography.com">Justin Welch Photography</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I was born in South Africa, lived for many years in the UK and am now based in Costa Rica. As a landscape, urban, portrait and travel photographer, I love to explore new destinations, both well known and off the beaten track. There is
          something
          special about slowly wandering the streets of a city or paths in the countryside, absorbing the sights and sounds from which I draw my inspiration.</p>
